# SEM_Image_Analysis
Python scripts for analysing SEM images


## Requirements

This code requires [Python](http://www.python.org) to run. Currently Python 3.6+ should work. 
Scripts have the following dependencies:  
OpenCV  
Numpy  
Scipy  
Matplotlib  


## Installation

Clone the repository to a directory of your choice:
~~~
 git clone git://github.com/Kenny-Jolley/SEM_Image_Analysis.git
~~~


## Usage

The scripts are best used via the commandline.  You should call the script and pass the filename of the image as an argument.

For example:
`script.py filename`  


### Example Images

This folder contains a collection of example images that can be analysed by the scripts.
